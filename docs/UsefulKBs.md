**[Uninstall Office from a PC](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8)** *`The following steps describe how to uninstall Office products on a PC. Uninstalling Office only removes the Office applications from your computer, it doesn't remove any files, documents, or workbooks you created using the Office apps.You can't uninstall an individual app such as Word or Publisher that's included as part of your Office Suite installation. The only way to uninstall an individual app is if you purchased it as a stand-alone version.`*
